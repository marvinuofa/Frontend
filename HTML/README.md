# HTML-only Projects

This folder contains projects built using **only HTML**.  
The goal here is to practice building the structure and layout of web pages without using CSS or JavaScript.

## üß† What I'm Practicing

- Semantic HTML elements
- Page structure and layout
- Forms and input fields
- Tables, lists, and links
